# Halloween-themed-last-person-alive-program
Writing a program that can compute the last remaining person based on some rules
Instructions

It is Halloween, and a crazy serial killer has captured you and your friends (and also stole your trick-or-treating candy). The masked killer has you all lined up, side-by-side, and he tells you all that only 1 person will leave this secluded shed alive. He then asks you for a number. You tell him “3”. He tells you and your friends that he is going to start pointing at each of you, one by one, starting at the beginning of the line. Once he has counted 3 times, he will kill the person he lands on. Then he will start counting again to the next person, killing each time he counts to three. When he gets to the end, he wraps back around to the front and continues the count. One by one, he kills you and your friends until only one person remains. He takes the candy and leaves you to run for your life.

In this lab, you are going to write a program that can compute the last remaining person based on the rules above. The program should accept a list of all the people (input their names) and then the magic number. The program should then run a simulation of the scenario described above, listing the order in which people are eliminated as well as the surviving member.
